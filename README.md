## Description

This READEME goes over the project, which is a website that meets the accesibility standards using various alt tags on all img elements. The website also uses proper HTML structure as well as semantic elements with heading attributes that fall in sequential order.    

## Modifications 

- Implemented semantic elements
- HTML elements follow logical structure 
- Alt tags on images
- Title has concise and descriptive title
- Left the code I worked on a little better than I found it

## Conclusion 

<strong>Changes and Additions</strong>

1. Meta viewport elements gives the instructions to the browser for the appropriate screen width of the device. 
2. Alt attributes to the icon and image elements so if the image doesn't load the text will diplay what it is or if the the browser is not visible, text to audio will say what the listener would've been able to see. 
3. Using Scout Rule to leave code cleaner than I was given. 
4. Used Semantic Elements for accessibility.
